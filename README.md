# Real vs. Fake Face Detection with Inception ResNet V1

This project aims to tackle the challenge of distinguishing between real and fake face images using a deep learning approach. We trained an Inception ResNet V1 model on a balanced dataset comprising 140,000 images (70,000 real and 70,000 fake) to achieve this goal. The project encompasses model training, evaluation, and potential deployment strategies while considering ethical implications and biases.

## Project Overview

The motivation behind this project is to enhance the security and reliability of systems relying on facial recognition by effectively identifying fraudulent attempts. Given the increasing sophistication of digital impersonation techniques, this project contributes to the ongoing efforts in digital security and fraud prevention.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 140,000 images, evenly divided between real and fake face images. The fake images were generated using advanced techniques to challenge the model's ability to discern between genuine and counterfeit identities.

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: Inception ResNet V1
- **Training Data**: 140,000 images (70k real, 70k fake)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install several dependencies, primarily focusing on TensorFlow and other machine learning libraries. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:


## Usage

To train the model with the dataset, simply execute the training script:
python train_model.py


Adjust the script parameters based on your computational resources and desired model complexity.

## Evaluation and Results

We evaluated the model's performance using several metrics, focusing on its ability to generalize to unseen data. The results indicate a robust capability to differentiate between real and fake images, with further details provided in the `results` section.

## Ethical Considerations

This project is mindful of the ethical implications of facial recognition technology, particularly concerning privacy and bias. Efforts were made to ensure the dataset's diversity and representativeness to minimize bias in model predictions.

## Future Work

- Exploring data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- Implementing ensemble methods for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- Continuous model re-training to adapt to evolving digital impersonation techniques.
